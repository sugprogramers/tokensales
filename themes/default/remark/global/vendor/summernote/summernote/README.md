### LibreICONS theme for Summernote

This is a simple replacement for the Font Theme supplied by the Summernote Team, but not everyone wants to use Font Icons, so we made this theme using the LibreICONS SVG Icons.

To add, simply copy the `summernote-libreicons-theme.css` to your css folder, and copy the SVG folder outside of your css folder (like how the theme's folder structure is).

Then include the css file after Summernote's css include.

We've also included some extra classes for, well, at least for the plugins we've created for Summernote. There's no reason you can't add more, or even change the icons.

`note-icon-edit`: To show Editing option for [summernote-image-attributes](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/summernote-image-attributes).

`note-icon-browse-media`: For Toolbar Icon for [elFinder](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/LibreICONS/tree/master/themes/elFinder).

`note-icon-save`: For Toolbar Icon for [summernote-save-button](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/LibreICONS/tree/master/themes/summernote).
